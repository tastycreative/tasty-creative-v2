SHIFT REPORT 
================================

SUMMARY:
Changing inputs based on event type
Database creation and API and function creation for adding events
UI and code changes
Removed static data for live data from database
Testing

PROBLEMS SOLVED/FEATURES ADDED:
================================

1. EVENT BASED INPUTS
    PPV type has different input with LIVESTREAM event making them have different details
    PPV events show price field, content link, edited video link, and flyer link
    LIVESTREAM events show live type field for different streaming platforms
    Added ZOD validation schema for required fields (Date, Event Type, Creator)
    Required fields now validated before submission to prevent incomplete events

2. DATABASE and API
    Created ContentEvent table in schema.prisma with all necessary fields
    Added fields: title, date, time, type, creator, tags, price, status, color, notes
    Added optional fields: contentLink, editedVideoLink, flyerLink, liveType
    Updated schema multiple times during testing to match actual requirements
    Created POST API endpoint at /api/content-events for creating new events
    Created GET API endpoint at /api/content-events/[id] for fetching single events

3. UI and CODE CHANGES
    Created EventForm component - reusable for both create and view modes
    EventForm changes inputs dynamically based on event type selected
    Added red border styling and error messages for required fields validation
    Error messages appear below each field with clear text ("Date is required", etc.)
    Created modal for dates with 2+ events - shows full list when clicking "+X more"
    Added ModelsDropdownList hasError prop to support red border when creator missing
    Made calendar timezone-aware to prevent date shifting issues
    Fixed date picker to show correct local date without timezone conversion bugs
    Real-time error clearing - errors disappear immediately when field is filled
    Improved component reusability by separating form logic from modal logic

4. TESTING
    Tested event creation flow end-to-end from UI to database
    Debugged timezone issues with date selection and display
    Fixed validation triggering and error clearing behavior
    Tested both PPV and LIVESTREAM event types with different field combinations
    Verified required field validation works correctly for all three fields
    Tested modal behavior for dates with multiple events
    Verified API successfully saves events to database with correct data types

IMPACT:
================================
- Users can now create PPV and LIVESTREAM events with type-specific fields
- Form prevents incomplete events from being saved to database
- Clear visual feedback shows users exactly what fields are required
- Errors disappear instantly when fixed, making form feel responsive
- Calendar correctly handles timezones - no more date shifting bugs
- Users can view all events on busy dates through the expanded modal
- Better code organization with reusable EventForm component
- Database properly stores all event information with correct structure
- API endpoints ready for production use with authentication
- Validation ensures data quality and consistency across all events
